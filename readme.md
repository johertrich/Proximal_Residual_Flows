# Proximal Residual Flows for Bayesian Inverse Problems

This code belongs to the paper [4]. Please cite the corresponding paper, if you use this code.

The paper is available at  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17158

The repository contains an implementation of Proximal Residual Flows as introduced in [4]. 
Proximal Residual Flows are an architecture for normalizing flows based on invertible residual flows [1, 2] and proximal neural networks [3, 5].
The repository contains the code for reproducing the toy density examples from Section 4.1 and the circle example from Section 4.2 from [4].
More examples will be added soon.

The code is written in python with Tensorflow 2.10.0.
